<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


Hi there! My name is Andreas Katis and I am a Computer Scientist for KBR, Inc. and a member of NASA Ames's Robust Software Engineering group (RSE). My research background is in the application of formal methods for the analysis of software systems, primarily at the level of requirements. I earned my BSc degree from the [Computer Engineering and Informatics Department (C.E.I.D.)](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en) at the University of Patras. I received my MsC and PhD in Computer Science from the [University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/cs) in 2020, under the supervision of Dr. Michael W. Whalen. My PhD thesis was on the development of realizability checking and reactive synthesis techniques for infinite-state problems.
